What was the most difficult part of this assignment for you?

The most difficult part of this assingment was dealing with all of the different functions and how
to make them work together so that input validation was correct, as well as all of the graphical elements.

What was the easiest?

The easiest part of this assignment was the actual calculations and if statements for the game. My problems
came in when I was dealing with multiple objects inside and outside functions/loops.

If you were to expand this idea and add more features, what would
you add and why?

Expanding upon this idea, I would want to make the UI more user friendly and faster with keyboard shortcuts.

Having completed the assignment, if you were to redo it, what
would change in your approach/strategy? How would your
implementation be different from your first attempt? Would it be
easier or harder the second time?

If i was to redo this assingment I would NOT add all of the extra functions and input validation.
THe original time to create this assignment was 40 minuts but by adding the extra features it took me over
5 hours.
