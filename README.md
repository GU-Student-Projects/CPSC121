# CPSC121

Projects for Gonzaga CPSC121 taught by Bryan Fischer. Most of these projects include functions which at the time of writing have not been taught in class yet. If you are looking for help on how to do the assignment itself, check both the **VOID** functions with the assignment name on them: `void tankGame(){...} ` and the **MAIN** function.

This repository is NOT to be copied and I do not codone cheating for CPSC assignments. This is to be used as a tool to help understand the assignment.

## Usage

All projects contain a **make** file to run the project.
